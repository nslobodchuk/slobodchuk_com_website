title: Cost of Vacation in Different Cities in the World
---

Recently I needed to scrape [Booking](http://www.booking.com) and [Skyscanner](http://www.skyscanner.com) in order to obtain the cost of vacation in different cities and countries. The cost of vacation includes the cost of staying at a hotel and the airplane ticket assuming you fly out from Moscow. I plotted various vacation spots on the map and used viridis color scale to show the relative cost of vacation. I also made the visualization interactive. When you mouseover a vacation spot you can see the name of the place and the cost of vacation. To see the interactive version follow [this link](/data/cost_of_vacation/index.html).
